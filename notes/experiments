- for some giant project (kernel, make, gcc, python, pcre), faster incremental build
- faster 16 CPU full compile
- python MinGW build
- write an Ejabberd build system from scratch
- compile with whitespace in filename
- standalone cross-platform Makefile
- standalone bytecode-compile to sh configure
- standalone bytecode-compile to bat configure
- self-hosting on Awk and WHS Javascript, to resolve text and filesystem enconding issues
- transparently run compiles in fuse tmpfs for large speedup
