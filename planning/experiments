- for some giant project (kernel, make, gcc, python, pcre), faster incremental build
- faster 16 CPU full compile
- python MinGW build
- write an Ejabberd build system from scratch
- compile with whitespace in filename
- standalone cross-platform Makefile
- standalone bytecode-compile to sh configure
- standalone bytecode-compile to bat configure
- self-hosting on Awk and WHS Javascript, to resolve text and filesystem enconding issues
- transparently run compiles in tmpfs (rsync-style) for large speedup, using a pch for every header file
- replacement build scripts for a Windows package manager (CoApp, Zero Install, Npackd, Portable Apps)
- user-specified DAG for automatic includes
- dependent-files visualization / query (gcc -H)
- low cost continuous builder (with good notifications)
- fake (parameterized) codebase comparisons
- warn about system resource starvation
